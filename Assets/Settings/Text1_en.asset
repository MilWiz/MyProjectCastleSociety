    m_Localized: Christianity in medieval times was a huge religion and it still
      is to this day. It dominated Medieval Europe and it was important for politics
      and daily life. The Latin Vulgate was a translation of the Bible by Saint Jerome,
      at that time. Manuscripts were made from the Bible and finally portions of
      the Bible were being read in Churces.

    m_Localized: Books in medieval times were very expensive, hard-copied and not
      as common as they are today. Scribes at those times were creating manuscripts
      of books to keep their context alive throughout history. Back then there were
      no digital forms, so they had to be copied by hand. In medieval times there
      were books of poetry, religious works, story collections and more.

      this again?

    m_Localized: Candlesticks as weird as it may seem were very important for medieval
      times. Those were used to light up the dark(since there was no electricity
      back then) to provide a useful light source in need. There were used in houses,
      churches and finally public spaces. The simplest form of domestic candlestick
      was a block of wool into the top of which an iron spike was driven vertically.
      The lower end was impaled on the spike and the upper end lighted.

    m_Localized: Medieval crossbows were a highly effective weapon that became important
      from the 10th Century. This weapon was capable of penetrating armor with minimal
      training(since all you had to do was shoot from afar). It was an enhancement
      of bows and it was used to fire arrows at soldiers, killing them in the process.
      The first medieval crossbows were made of wood, usually yew and olive wood.

      time is it?... It's Hammer Time.
